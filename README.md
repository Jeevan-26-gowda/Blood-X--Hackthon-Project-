# BloodX – Next-Gen Blood Coordination System

## 🚑 Problem Statement
Hospitals and blood banks often face delays, shortages, and wastage due to inefficient centralized systems. BloodX provides a **decentralized, real-time platform** connecting hospitals, blood banks, and donors to ensure timely blood availability and optimal utilization.

## 🌟 Key Features
1. **Real-Time Distributed Inventory Management**  
   - Maintains tamper-proof records of blood stock across hospitals and blood banks (simulated blockchain).  

2. **Automated Demand-Supply Matching**  
   - Matches hospital blood requests with nearest compatible blood banks based on blood type, expiry, and urgency.  

3. **Donor Network Integration with Emergency Alerts**  
   - Notifies registered donors nearby during urgent requirements.  

4. **Secure Traceability**  
   - QR-based tracking of blood units from donation → storage → transfusion.  

5. **Incentive & Reputation System**  
   - Rewards donors, hospitals, and blood banks for timely and reliable participation.

## 🔮 Additional Enhancements
- **Map Integration (Google Maps / Leaflet)** → visualize nearest hospitals, blood banks, and donors.  
- **AI Demand Forecasting** → predicts shortages in advance for proactive planning.  
- **Multi-Language Support** → accessible to local communities (English + Hindi).

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / HTML + CSS (Bootstrap)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) / Python (Flask)  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Firebase  
- **Blockchain Simulation:** Custom ledger to track blood unit transfers  
- **AI/ML:** Python (scikit-learn, Pandas) for demand forecasting  
- **Maps API:** Google Maps / Leaflet.js  
- **QR & Notifications:** Python qrcode library, Twilio / Firebase Cloud Messaging

## 🚀 Demo Flow
1. Hospital raises a blood request.  
2. System finds nearest compatible blood bank → displayed on map.  
3. Low-stock alerts trigger notifications to nearby donors.  
4. QR code scan shows full traceability of blood units.  
5. Donor receives reward tokens → leaderboard updates.
